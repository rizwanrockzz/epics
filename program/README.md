Recognition of Doctors’ Handwriting by Efficient Machine Learning Algorithm to Reduce Medical Errors

## Abstract
#### ~ Machine-Learning ~<br>
As the doctors do not want to spend much time writing prescriptions, they write very fast. As a result, the readers of the prescription find them difficult to read. In order to assist the doctor with their handwriting, we are proposing a machine learning based handwriting recognition system to predict doctors’ handwriting and develop a digital prescription. 
#### ~ Data-Augmentation ~<br>
In the field of Online Handwriting recognition for medical, there is no datasets.
And, it takes times and labor to collect data.
In addition,  if the diversity of data is low,  it will be difficult to recognize a variety of handwriting data.
So, in this research, expand a research date.
